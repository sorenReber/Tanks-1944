# Overview


A top-down shooter where the player is a tank. The player can move the tank using either the arrow keys or WASD:
* W to move forward.
* S to move backward.
* A to turn left.
* D to turn right.

The turret will follow the mouse position within the window. Players will have to take into account acceleration, deceleration, reload speed, and the turret rotation speed. (In its current state there are no enemies though, just trees to shoot.)

I think that creating games is a really fun thing to do and is excellent motivation for creating projects that challenge anyones programming skills. I also wanted to make a game that my kids could play that is quick to get into and pick up.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

* Future addition: Enemies! A shooter of any perspective needs enemies to shoot!
* Future addition: A win/loss condition and ending to the game.
* Future Addition: Add GUI elements, things like a health bar, something to show the player when they've reloaded. Maybe even the ability to select different shells or abilities.
